ðŸŽ¯ Final Project â€“ 15 Puzzle Game using React
For our final project, we created an interactive 15 Puzzle Game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React JS. This project brought together all the concepts and technologies weâ€™ve learned so far in a fun and practical way.

A 4x4 15 Puzzle Game with numbered tiles and one empty space

Logic to move adjacent tiles into the blank space on click

"New Game" button to shuffle and restart the puzzle

Clean and modern UI built with HTML structure, CSS styling, and Bootstrap classes

Game logic handled using JavaScript and React state management

Applied everything we learned so far in one full-stack front-end project

ðŸ§  Key Takeaways
Used HTML to structure the page layout

Applied CSS and Bootstrap to style and make the game responsive

Implemented JavaScript logic to handle tile movement and game rules

Used React components and state to build an interactive and dynamic UI

Learned how to combine different technologies to build a complete web application
