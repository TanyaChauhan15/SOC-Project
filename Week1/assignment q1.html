        <h3><b>About Me</b></h3>
        I am a first-year undergraduate student at the Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIT Bombay, currently exploring the intersection of engineering design, electronics, and programming. I am learning Python and HTML to expand my technical toolkit and support my growing interest in data science and web development. As a trainee in the Electrical Subsystem of IITB Racing, I am gaining hands-on experience with electrical systems in high-performance electric vehicles. I also serve as a Convenor in the Aeromodelling Club, where I lead aviation-related initiatives and student engagement. I am passionate about learning by doing, and I enjoy collaborating on multidisciplinary technical projects.
